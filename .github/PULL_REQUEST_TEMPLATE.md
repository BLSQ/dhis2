## Self proof reading checklist

- [ ] Did I run Pronto and fixed all warnings
- [ ] Make sure all naming and code will remain understandable in 6 month by someone new to the project or by you.
- [ ] Did I test the right thing?
- [ ] Did I test corner cases, non happy path (defensive testing)?
- [ ] Check that I used the ad-hoc patterns and created files accordingly (Presenters, Services, Search object, Form object,...)
- [ ] Check code efficiency with record intensive project (eg: DRC)
- [ ] Update documentation,readme accordingly

Thanks!
